    <h1>Poor Man's Pac-Man</h1>
    <p1>Instructions: Avoid the enemy ghosts and survive as long as possible. Click the mouse to deploy a scarecrow that draws enemies away from your player for five seconds. Click any key to delete half of the enemy ghosts. Be aware that this can only be
      used after the player's health decreases below 50 and that every use of this power-up decreases the player speed slightly.</p1>
